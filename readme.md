## Organize your code
in this repository you will find 2 different ways to organize your code, the simple way and the programmer way.

### The simple way
you split your logic into functions that you need for your projects and notebooks that you use to visualize data and show final results.
1. the code is in `starthere/simple.m`
2. the notebook used for visualization is in `starthere/simple.nb`

### The programmer way
I prepared a very simple project paclet you can use, it provides a way to organize your code and your data

1. the code is in paclet in `starthere/Project` folder
2. raw source data can be put in `starthere/Project/Assets/` folder
3. the notebook used for visualization is in `starthere/advanced.nb`
